The `OliveImages` module provides [Olive](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl) with the ability to read and work with image files, including
- SVG files
- PNG files
- GIF files
- and JPG files.

For now, the only feature offered is opening and viewing images in a project alone. Future functionality will include sourcing images from files in projects and editing images.
- To add this `Olive` extension, add `using OliveImages` to your `olive` home after adding this package. For information on this, check out [installing extensions](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl#installing-extensions).
